1. Introduction

	This protocol specification was determined by reverse
	engineering the modulated control signals sent from the
	controller handset. These signals were sniffed using a
	Salea Logic logic-analyzer and manually decoded to determine
	their meaning.
	
	So far I have encountered two distinct versions of the Syma
	107G handset, each with its own variation of the control
	protocol. These appear to be related to the version of the
	controller board within the (otherwise identical) handsets.
	These versions can be identified by the following silkscreened
	markings:
	
	Revision  PCB Date  Location on PCB
	--------  --------  ------------------------------------------
      -  S107T1	  20090818  Underneath yaw/pitch and throttle control.
      -  S107T2   20100308  Underneath yaw/pitch and on right of PCB.
                                   
	For the purposes of this document, the changes in protocol
	will be labelled with one of the above Revision names. Other
	than any labelled differences, the two versions are identical.
	
	
2. Physical Specification

	The Syma 107G is a 3-channel (Yaw, Pitch, Throttle) coaxial
	RC helicopter which utilizes Infrared (IR) communications for
	control via battery-operated handset.
	
	The control communications are open-loop and solely consists of
	one-way traffic. There is no parity or error checking.
	
	The transmission of a control packet is contingent on the
	application of throttle
	
	
2.1. Infrared Wavelength 

	The IR wavelength appears to be 940nm.


2.2. Carrier Modulation Frequency

	The control signal is modulated at the following frequency:
	
	- 38khz
	  - 50% duty cycle
	  - 26us period
	    - 13us high/13us low


2.3. Symbol Encoding

	The control packet is encoded with pulse-length encoding. The
	following pulse lengths represent all 4 possible symbols:
	
	Symbol	High Length(us)	Low Length (us)	Period
	------  ---------------	---------------	------
      - Header	2000 us 	2000 us  	4 ms
      - Zero	300 us		300 us		0.6 ms
      - One	300 us		700 us		1 ms
      - Footer	300 us		>2000 us	N/A


2.4. Channels

	The Syma 107G supports 2 channels; Ch.A and Ch.B.
	
	Channels are not differentiated by modulation frequency, but
	simply by a specific control bit within the packet. This is
	described in Section 3.2.3.
	
	In order to minimize control packet collisions, the
	transmission interval is different between Ch.A and Ch.B:
	
	Ch.A. - TX Interval: 120ms (8.33 packets per second)
	Ch.B. - TX Interval: 180ms (5.55 packets per second)
	
	The Ch.B. interval is 1.5x the interval of Ch.A., therefore
	should two controllers transmit in-phase with each other,
	packet collisions will occur every other packet for
	Ch.B. (approximately 3 times a second).
	

3. Control Packet Specification

3.1. Packet Structure

	The two controller versions have different length control
	packets - S107T1 has a 24-bit packet, S107T2 has a 32-bit 
	packet.

	* - The S107T2 controller implements a 4th byte responsive to
	the Trim knob; however, actual Trim functionality is
	implemented by manipulating the Yaw control. See Section 3.2.5.


3.2. Control Definition

3.2.1. Yaw

	Yaw control is represented by a linear decimal value between
	0 and 127, centered on 63:
	
	
	 <--------Right Turn--------> <--------Left Turn--------->
	|----------------------------+----------------------------|
	0                            ^                           127
		  	  	 Center (63)        

	On the S107T1 and S107T2 controllers, the Yaw control is
	mechanically centered with a return spring when not in use.


3.2.2. Pitch

	Pitch control is represented by a linear decimal value between
	0 and 127, centered on 63:
	
	 <-------Pitch Forward------> <------Pitch Backward------>
	|----------------------------+----------------------------|
	0                            ^                           127
		  	  	 Center (63)  

	On the S107T1 and S107T2 controllers, the Pitch control is
	mechanically centered with a return spring when not in use.


3.2.3. Channel

	NB - Channel select has a physical component - see Section 2.4.

	The Channel is controlled by a one-bit flag in position 16.
	
			       +-----+-------+
			       |Value|Channel|
			       +-----|-------|
			       |  0  |   A   |
			       |  1  |   B   |
                               +-----+-------+
                               

3.2.4. Throttle

	Throttle control is represented by a linear decimal value
	between 0 and 127.
	
	 <--- Low Throttle -------------------- High Throttle --->
	|---------------------------------------------------------|
	0                                                        127


	On the S107T1 and S107T2 controllers, the Throttle control is
	mechanically zeroed with a return spring when not in use.

3.2.5. Trim

	Trim control is achieved on both S107T1 and S107T2 by adjusting
	the Yaw value. This adjustment has a range of +/- 20.
	
	Trim controller knob position:
	
	 <---------Trim Right-------> <---------Trim Left-------->
	|----------------------------+----------------------------|
	+20 Yaw 	        Center (+/-0)		    -20 Yaw
	
	Additionally, the S107T2 controller transmits an additional
	4th byte which reflects the Trim knob setting; however, it does
	not appear that this byte is used by the S107G to modify Trim.
	It seems likely that this byte is part of the control mechanism
	for other models.
	
	This additional Trim-responsive field is represented by a 
	linear decimal value between 0 and 127, centered on 63:
	
	 <---------Trim Right--------> <---------Trim Left------->
	|----------------------------+----------------------------|
	0                            ^                           127
		  	  	 Center (63)
